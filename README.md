# TheMovieAPI

School Project - Submission Task

We were supposed to create an interface for The Movie DB (TMDB) where users can view the latest movies in theaters, the most popular movies, and the top-rated movies in Sweden (or the USA). Users should also be able to browse movies based on genre.

Additionally, wherever a movie is displayed, users should be able to click on it to view information about the movie and the actors involved. It should also be possible to click on an actor to see the movies they have appeared in.

## Technical Requirements: </br>
- Component-based </br>
- Uses React Router </br>
- Uses React Query </br>
- The communication with the API should be handled in a separate middleware layer (a "service" where the Fetch/axios communication takes place).
